# Client Side Email Generator for Convio

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/monofrio/ClientSideEmailBuilder.svg?branch=Master)](https://travis-ci
.org/monofrio/ClientSideEmailBuilder)

> This is in **Pre-alpha**

This is designed to create simple email development tool for users with no experience with HTML.
The challenge to this application is to develope it so it doesn't have to rely on a server but uses the client side browser to create an ready to use email to be copied and pasted into an email host to send out.

## Getting Started

This app is using frameworks to help development and streamline the application.
Using Twitter Bootstraps for the front-end while taken advantage of Angular MVC to bring the application together. This application is developed to be used on the client side (browser like Chrome) instead of a server.
