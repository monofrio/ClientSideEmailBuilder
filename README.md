First challenge is to build a way to create an easy and fast responsive HTML email template.
By using [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) to davelope the HTML structure and [Foundation Ink](http://foundation.zurb.com/emails.html) as the base CSS structure and having Gulp bring it all together.

The second challenge is to create an application that doesn't rely on a server but can create HTML emails be used that have no experience with HTML.
Also this application will need to work on the clientside without using a server.  The user will beable to fill out a form to build this email and have the end result output the HTML.
